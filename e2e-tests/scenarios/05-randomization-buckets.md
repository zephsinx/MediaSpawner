- Selected assets highlighted or marked
- Member count updates in dialog (if shown)

### 9. Save Bucket Members

**Action**:

1. Find "Done" or "Save" button in members dialog
2. `click(uid: "[save-members-button-uid]")`

**Expected**:

- Dialog closes
- Bucket card updates to show "Members: 2" or similar
- Changes saved

### 10. Verify Bucket Chips on Assets

**Action**:

1. Take snapshot of right panel "Assets in Current Spawn" section
2. Look for bucket indicators on asset chips

**Expected**:

- "Test Image Asset" chip shows bucket indicator
- "Test Video Asset" chip shows bucket indicator
- Bucket indicator displays bucket name or icon
- Tooltip or label shows "Visual Elements" bucket

### 11. Create Second Bucket - Mode "N"

**Action**:

1. Scroll to Randomization Buckets section
2. Click "Add Bucket" button again
3. Fill form:
   - Name: "Audio Options"
   - Selection mode: "n"
   - Number: 2

**Expected**:

- Second bucket creation dialog opens
- When selection mode set to "n", number input appears
- Number input accepts value "2"

### 12. Save Second Bucket

**Action**: Click Save button in dialog

**Expected**:

- Second bucket created successfully
- Both buckets now visible in section
- Second bucket shows "Pick 2" or "Pick N (2)"

### 13. Add Asset to Library for Second Bucket

**Action**:

1. Navigate to Asset Library (if needed to add more audio assets)
2. OR work with existing assets if enough available
3. Return to spawn view

**Expected**:

- Additional assets available for assignment
- OR proceed with existing assets

### 14. Verify Bucket Validation

**Action**:

1. Take snapshot of both buckets
2. Verify bucket section shows no errors

**Expected**:

- Both buckets valid
- No error indicators
- All invariants met:
  - Each asset in at most one bucket
  - "n" value â‰¤ enabled member count

### 15. Test Bucket Editing

2. Click "Save" button
3. `click(uid: "[save-spawn-button-uid]")`

**Expected**:

- Save completes successfully
- Bucket configuration persisted
- Success notification appears

### 18. Verify Persistence

**Action**:

1. Switch to different spawn
2. Switch back to "Test Spawn Alpha"
3. Scroll to Randomization Buckets section

**Expected**:

- Bucket "Visual Elements" still present
- Members still assigned (2 assets)
- Configuration unchanged
- Bucket chips still visible on assets

### 19. Take Final Screenshot

**Action**: `take_screenshot(filePath: "e2e-tests/screenshots/05-randomization-buckets-complete.png", fullPage: true)`

**Expected**:

- Screenshot shows bucket section with configured bucket
- Asset chips with bucket indicators visible

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can create randomization buckets with both selection modes
- [ ] Can open members editor and add assets to bucket
- [ ] Members editor shows all spawn assets with checkboxes
- [ ] Bucket member count updates correctly
- [ ] Bucket chips/indicators appear on assets in spawn
- [ ] Can delete buckets
- [ ] Bucket configuration persists with spawn
- [ ] Bucket validation works (no duplicate assignments)
- [ ] No console errors during operations

## Performance Target

- Create bucket: < 200ms
- Open members editor: < 150ms
- Add/remove members: < 100ms per operation
- Save bucket config: < 200ms

## Data State After Test

After this scenario:

- "Test Spawn Alpha" has one randomization bucket:
  - Name: "Visual Elements"
  - Selection mode: "one"
  - Members: 2 (Test Image Asset, Test Video Asset)
- Bucket configuration persisted in spawn data

## Common Issues

- **Members editor not opening**: Check spawn has assets assigned first
- **Checkboxes not toggling**: Ensure correct UID from snapshot, check for disabled state
- **Bucket chips not showing**: May need to scroll or refresh right panel
- **Validation errors**: Ensure "n" value doesn't exceed member count
- **Assets can't be in multiple buckets**: Expected behavior, move asset to different bucket if needed
