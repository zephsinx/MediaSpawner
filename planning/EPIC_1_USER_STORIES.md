## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: MS-1
**Epic**: Data Model & Services Foundation
**Priority**: 1 (Critical Path)
**Status**: Not Started

Create type definitions and services to support the new spawn-centric architecture with enabled/disabled states, active profile management, and spawn-specific asset settings.

## Story 1: Set Up Spawn Data Foundation

**Story ID**: MS-10
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 3 points
**Status**: Not Started

**User Story**:
As a user, I want spawns to have clear properties and structure, so that I can create organized collections of media assets with consistent behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Can create spawns with names and descriptions
- [ ] Spawns can be enabled or disabled
- [ ] Spawns support trigger and duration settings
- [ ] Spawns can contain multiple assets
- [ ] Spawn data validates properly when saved

**Technical Task MS-1-T1**: Implement Spawn Interface

- Create Spawn interface with: id, name, enabled, trigger, duration, assets[]
- Design SpawnAsset interface for spawn-specific asset instances
- Include inheritance settings for default properties
- Add proper JSDoc documentation
- Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Design for future OBS-style settings expansion

**Dependencies**: None

## Story 2: Set Up Spawn Profile Organization

**Story ID**: MS-11
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 3 points
**Status**: Not Started

**User Story**:
As a user, I want to organize my spawns into profiles, so that I can manage different collections of spawns for different projects or contexts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Can create profiles to organize spawns
- [ ] Each profile has a name and description
- [ ] Only one profile is active at a time
- [ ] Profile data saves and loads correctly
- [ ] Can track when profiles were last modified

**Technical Task MS-2-T1**: Implement SpawnProfile Interface

- Create SpawnProfile interface with: id, name, description, spawns[], lastModified
- Support active profile identification
- Ensure compatibility with localStorage JSON serialization
- Maintain proper relationship to spawns array
- Add proper JSDoc documentation

**Dependencies**: Story 1 (Spawn interface)

## Story 3: Manage Individual Spawns

**Story ID**: MS-12
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 5 points
**Status**: Not Started

**User Story**:
As a user, I want to create, edit, and delete spawns, so that I can build and maintain my spawn configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Can create new spawns with default settings
- [ ] Can update spawn properties and save changes
- [ ] Can delete spawns I no longer need
- [ ] Can enable and disable spawns quickly
- [ ] Changes persist when I restart the application
- [ ] Clear error messages when operations fail

**Technical Task MS-3-T1**: Implement SpawnService CRUD Operations

- Implement createSpawn(), getSpawn(), updateSpawn(), deleteSpawn()
- Add enableSpawn(), disableSpawn() methods
- Include localStorage persistence with error handling
- Integrate with existing CacheService for performance
- Add spawn validation logic
- Handle edge cases (empty profiles, invalid IDs)
- Include unit tests with >90% coverage

**Dependencies**: Stories 1, 2

---

## Story 4: Manage Spawn Profiles and Active Selection

**Story ID**: MS-13
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 5 points
**Status**: Not Started

**User Story**:
As a user, I want to switch between different spawn profiles, so that I can work with different sets of spawns based on my current project or context.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Can create, edit, and delete spawn profiles
- [ ] Can switch between profiles easily
- [ ] Active profile is remembered when I restart the application
- [ ] Profile switching resets my current context appropriately
- [ ] Clear feedback when profile operations succeed or fail

**Technical Task MS-4-T1**: Implement SpawnProfileService

- Replace existing ConfigurationService
- Implement profile CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete
- Add setActiveProfile() and getActiveProfile() methods
- Handle profile switching behavior with context reset
- Integrate with SettingsService for active profile persistence
- Include proper cache invalidation on profile switches
- Add profile validation and name uniqueness
- Include unit tests with >90% coverage

**Dependencies**: Stories 1, 2

---

## Story 5: Support Spawn-Specific Asset Settings

**Story ID**: MS-14
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 3 points
**Status**: Not Started

**User Story**:
As a user, I want assets to have different settings in different spawns, so that the same asset can behave differently depending on which spawn it's used in.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Assets can have unique settings per spawn
- [ ] Asset settings inherit from spawn defaults
- [ ] Can override individual asset properties per spawn
- [ ] Asset settings save separately for each spawn
- [ ] Settings load correctly when switching spawns

**Technical Task MS-5-T1**: Extend AssetService for Spawn Settings

- Add getSpawnAssetSettings(spawnId, assetId) method
- Add setSpawnAssetSettings(spawnId, assetId, settings) method
- Implement data structure for SpawnAsset instances
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing asset operations
- Design inheritance model: Spawn defaults → SpawnAsset overrides

**Dependencies**: Stories 1, 2, 3, 4

---

## Story 6: Optimize Asset Settings Performance

**Story ID**: MS-15
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimate**: 3 points
**Status**: Not Started

**User Story**:
As a user with many spawns and assets, I want asset operations to remain fast, so that I can work efficiently even with large configurations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Asset settings load quickly even with many spawns
- [ ] Switching between spawns feels responsive
- [ ] Can handle dozens of assets per spawn efficiently
- [ ] No noticeable delays when configuring asset settings

**Technical Task MS-6-T1**: Implement Performance Optimizations

- Optimize asset settings operations for large asset lists
- Implement efficient storage structure for spawn-asset relationships
- Add performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Consider storage structure optimizations
- Include unit tests with >90% coverage
- Profile performance with large datasets

**Dependencies**: Story 5

## Definition of Done

Each story is complete when:

- [ ] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean (no errors, minimal warnings)
- [ ] Integration with existing services works
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (localStorage operations cached)
- [ ] Documentation updated (JSDoc comments)
- [ ] Vision alignment validated against checklist

## Vision Validation Checklist

- [ ] Supports spawn enable/disable functionality ✓ (Stories 1, 3)
- [ ] Includes trigger configuration for future expansion ✓ (Story 1)
- [ ] Supports one active profile at a time ✓ (Stories 2, 4)
- [ ] Scalable to 100s of spawns per profile ✓ (All stories)
- [ ] Asset inheritance model implemented correctly ✓ (Stories 1, 5)
- [ ] Maintains clean, reusable asset library ✓ (Story 5)
- [ ] SpawnAsset data structure for inheritance ✓ (Stories 1, 5)

## Technical Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types
- **Testing**: Jest unit tests, >90% coverage
- **Performance**: All localStorage operations cached
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public methods
- **Error Handling**: Proper try/catch with meaningful errors

## Notes

- Build incrementally - each story should be functional independently
- Follow existing service patterns in codebase
- Keep interfaces flexible for future OBS integration
- No data migration required - fresh start approach
