- Design profile interface to not interfere with main spawn workflow
- Working directory setting follows inheritance pattern from Settings
- Profile switching must properly reset context for user understanding
- Default profile provides immediate usability for new users
- Integration with export/import enables profile backup and sharing
- All profile operations should integrate with existing caching and persistence layers
