- **Unified Workspace**: Configuration happens in center panel as designed
- **Context Switching**: Smooth transitions between spawn and asset configuration
- **Configuration Validation**: Clear feedback prevents invalid settings
- **Preview Capabilities**: Users can see changes before saving

## Integration Points with Other Epics

- **Epic 1**: Uses SpawnService and AssetService for configuration persistence
- **Epic 2**: Uses center panel and panel state management for unified workspace
- **Epic 3**: Extends spawn editor with default asset settings
- **Epic 4**: Receives asset configuration requests from asset management
- **Epic 6**: Provides configured assets for trigger-specific behavior

## User Value Delivered

After Epic 5, users can:

- âœ… Create and manage spawns (Epic 3)
- âœ… Add assets to spawns (Epic 4)
- âœ… Configure volume for audio/video files
- âœ… Set dimensions, scale, and coordinates for visual files
- âœ… Use spawn defaults with per-asset overrides
- âœ… Preview configuration changes

This provides the fine-grained asset control that makes spawns truly powerful for media management scenarios.

## Notes

- Focus on type-specific settings that match user requirements
- Implement inheritance model that simplifies common cases
- Use center panel for all configuration to maintain unified workspace
- Build comprehensive validation to prevent configuration errors
- Design for streaming/presentation use cases with real-time preview
- Ensure performance with many assets and complex configurations
