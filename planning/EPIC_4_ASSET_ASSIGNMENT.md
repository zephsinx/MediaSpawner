# Epic 4: Asset Assignment - User Stories

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: MS-4
**Epic**: Asset Assignment  
**Priority**: 4 (Critical Path - HIGH VALUE)
**Status**: Not Started

**User Value**: âœ¨ **Spawns become functional containers for media assets with support for local files and URLs - making spawns actually useful for media management!**

Enable users to assign assets to spawns, supporting both local file paths and URLs. Start with a simple "Add to Spawn" button workflow, then add drag & drop later.

## Critical Success Factors

- **Functional Spawns**: After this epic, spawns actually contain media assets
- **Dual Asset Support**: Both local files and URLs work seamlessly
- **Intuitive Assignment**: Drag & drop makes asset assignment natural
- **Proper Validation**: Clear feedback prevents invalid asset addition
- **Clean Interface**: Asset management doesn't clutter the spawn workflow

## Integration Points with Other Epics

- **Epic 1**: Uses SpawnService and AssetService for all asset operations
- **Epic 2**: Renders within right panel constraints, uses panel state management
- **Epic 3**: Responds to spawn selection changes to show relevant assets
- **Epic 5**: Provides asset assignment foundation for detailed configuration
- **Epic 6**: Assets will be configurable with trigger-specific settings

## User Value Delivered

After Epic 4, users can:

- âœ… Create and manage spawns (Epic 3)
- âœ… Add local files and URLs to spawns
- âœ… Organize assets within spawns
- âœ… Build functional media collections

This makes spawns genuinely useful for media management, delivering core value that justifies the application's existence.

## Notes

- Focus on making spawns functional containers for media assets
- Support both local files and URLs as specified in user requirements
- Keep drag & drop interface intuitive and responsive
- Build foundation for detailed asset configuration in Epic 5
- Ensure asset validation prevents common errors
- Design for scalability with large asset libraries
