- **Validation and Testing**: Users can verify triggers work before going live
- **Integration with Spawn Workflow**: Triggers integrate seamlessly with spawn management
- **Practical Configuration**: Settings match real streaming platform capabilities

## Integration Points with Other Epics

- **Epic 1**: Uses SpawnService for trigger configuration persistence
- **Epic 3**: Integrates trigger configuration into spawn editor
- **Epic 7**: Provides trigger configuration for JSON export
- **Epic 8**: Will use trigger information for profile management
- **Epic 9**: Will enhance with trigger analytics and advanced features

## User Value Delivered

After Epic 6, users can:

- âœ… Create and manage spawns (Epic 3)
- âœ… Add and configure assets (Epics 4, 5)
- âœ… Set up actionable triggers for spawns
- âœ… Respond to chat commands, channel points, and viewer events
- âœ… Configure triggers for subscriptions, cheers, and follows

- âœ… Build foundation for advanced triggers in future epics

This makes spawns truly interactive and responsive to real streaming scenarios, delivering the core "actionable spawns" functionality.

## Technical Considerations

- **Trigger Data Structure**: Flexible schema to support various trigger types
- **Validation Framework**: Extensible validation for different trigger configurations
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Safe trigger testing without affecting live settings
- **Integration Ready**: Trigger configuration format suitable for external system export
- **Performance**: Efficient trigger processing for real-time streaming scenarios

## Notes

- Focus on trigger types commonly used in streaming platforms
- Design trigger configuration to be intuitive for content creators
- Build validation that prevents common trigger setup mistakes
- Ensure trigger testing capabilities for safe configuration verification
- Plan trigger data structure for external system integration (OBS, etc.)
- Keep trigger UI practical and not overwhelming for complex configurations
